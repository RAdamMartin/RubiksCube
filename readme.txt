CSC418 Assignment 3 part 2
-----------------------

For part 2 I made a Rubik's cube running make should create a file rubiks. The 
user interface is simple. You can rotate any one face at a time by choosing it 
from the list. Once selected, changing the rotation field will rotate the 
selected face. If you choose a new face, the rotation will revert to 0, however
if you had rotated the previous face more than 45 deg, it will snap to the next
rotation instead of going back to the previous. Alternatively, simply click on 
the rotate button to rotate the selected face 90 deg counter-clockwise 
(orange/yellow is up).
